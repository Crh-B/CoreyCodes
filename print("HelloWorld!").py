print("HelloWorld!")

# Excesises for Corey.
# 1) Make a short story about yourself with the information stored as each of the different variable 
# types we talked about. Make sure to use at least 5 different variable types.
# 2) Make a list at least 10 elements long. Print out the list, then print out the first 3 elements of the list.
# then print the list in reverse order. Then print out the last 3 elements of the list.
# 3) Make a variable integer then use it in an if statement to find if it is odd or even.
# EXTRA : Do the same thing as in ex 1 but use a dictionary instead of variables.
